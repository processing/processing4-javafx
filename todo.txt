X fix the names of the dist files
X change type to "Renderer" (new category for 4.0 beta 8)


getting away from reliance on AWT
_ better JavaFX-specific ways to handle loadImage()?
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/56
_ implement selectInput/Output/Folder methods in PSurfaceFX
_ implement openLink() in PSurfaceFX


issues
_ Remove usage of com.sun.* in JavaFX library
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/208
_ many shift- keys not working properly in FX2D (added a test sketch)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5317
_ Hitting ESC in FX2D app on macOS throws IllegalStateException
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5249
_ wrong window size with fullScreen()
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4737
_ menu bar not hiding properly in exported applications with FX2D
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4527
_   hideMenuBar() called from setup() works fine
_   just call it around setup time?
_ the --hide-stop option not working (FX only? traces?)
_ make wiki about quirks
_   starving the thread makes things really slow down
_   keyPressed() is always uppercase, keyTyped() will be correct
_ do we really need setTextFont/Size when we already have Impl?
_ need keyPressed() to do lower and upper case
_ static mode sketches (draw once and halt w/o closing window)
_ fix display handling, line up the device order with AWT
_   https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/stage/Screen.html
_ noLoop()
_ present mode not working at all
_   stage in the center, clear the rest of the screen
_ createGraphics() should probably create PGraphicsJava2D
_   or is Canvas specific to the PGraphics, and we get another Context2D?
_   http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/canvas/Canvas.html
_ loadPixels() (also 2x)
_ text and fonts?
_   maybe helpful: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/Font+Setup
_ updatePixels()
_ save() and saveFrame()
_ get() and set()
_ clip/noClip
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3274
_ getNative() in PImage problematic because it gives back a BufferedImage
_   move loadImage() into PGraphics, with AWT version the default
_   or pass createImage() through to renderer?
_ implement external messages (moving the window)
_ implement PSurfaceFX.setIcon()
_ javafx not supported with ARM (so we're screwed on raspberry pi)
